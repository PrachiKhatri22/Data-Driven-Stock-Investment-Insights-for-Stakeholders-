# Data-Driven Stock Investment Insights for Stakeholders

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Investing in the stock market can be daunting for small investors, medium-scale businesses, and students who lack the resources and expertise to analyze complex stock data effectively. With the overwhelming amount of raw data available, identifying patterns, trends, and actionable insights requires advanced tools and technical knowledge. This often results in uninformed decisions, higher investment risks, and missed opportunities.

<h2>Why I Developed This Project</h2>
This project was developed to bridge the gap between raw stock data and actionable insights. I aimed to simplify stock analysis, enabling users with little to no experience in data analytics to make informed investment decisions. The focus was to provide an intuitive, user-friendly platform that delivers key insights through visualizations and dashboards, reducing analysis time and empowering users to make smarter, data-driven choices.

<h2>Who It Is Useful For</h2>
<b>Small Investors:</b> Individuals who want to make informed decisions about stock investments but lack advanced tools or analytical expertise.
<b>Medium-Scale Businesses:</b> Companies seeking to diversify or optimize their investments with data-backed insights into stock performance and trends.<br>
<b>Students:</b> Learners who are exploring finance and stock market trends, seeking a simplified way to understand complex data for educational and practical purposes.

<h2>Technology Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Tableau</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Dataset Used</h2>
Daily price data for indexes tracking stock exchanges from all over the world (United States, China, Canada, Germany, Japan, and more). The data was all collected from Yahoo Finance, which had several decades of data available for most exchanges.<br>
